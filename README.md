# challenge-fourteen-techblog
My repository for Challenge 14 of the bootcamp, where we had to build a full stack application for a tech blog from scratch

## What is the point of this app?
The point of this app is to be a fully functioning tech blog. Users can view posts written by other users, posts they themselves have written, and login/sign up for additional access to the website functionalities.

## How did I build this app?
I build this app primarily using javascript, node js, mysql2, handlebars, and express. There is a touch of html and css but this app is primarily javascript.

## What challenges did I come across? What did I enjoy?
It's challenging to venture into a new type of assignment you've never been exposed to before, but in a way that's what i enjoyed most was watching the dots connect and celebrating the little victories along the way.
